My programming journey started from fascination with Computer Aided Design (CAD) software. Instead of "Hello World!", it was four-bar linkage mechanism simulation using AutoLISP for me!

To learn Computer Aided Design (CAD) programming in depth, I did Masters at State University of New York at Buffalo. Courses in programming, heuristic optimization, advanced geometry helped me to start with C++, data structures.

Joining a fast-paced startup was a great opportunity. In addition to learning C++, STL, algorithm skills, I participated in other aspects of software development. Back in 2009-2010, we worked on building a fully functional CI/CD pipeline along with unit, integration automated testing!

Currently, I am working as Software Engineering Manager at Siemens PLM. Journey of learning new technologies is still continuing with recent Cloud Computing certification.
