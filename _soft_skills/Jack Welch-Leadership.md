## Jack Welch’s Leadership

I was introduced to [GE's Two-Decade Transformation: Jack Welch's Leadership](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=67) paper during a management training program. There are many articles written about his leadership and it is impossible to capture even brief summary.

Following are few things which I found very unique:

### Work-Out
Provided forum for employees to give suggestions to managers for improving processes and remove unnecessary bureaucratic work. This was on the spot decision making instead of managers procrastinating decisions.

### Leadership

> Chief Meaning Officer

> Generosity Gene

Provide clear understanding of where we are going (mission) and how we are going there (Behaviors/ Values).
Spent at-least 70% of time on people issues (mostly teaching and developing others).
Providing freedom to team to be creative.
Inspire performance instead of forcing.

### Type 4 Managers

Instead of just looking at performance/ numbers, make sure company values are uphold.
Evaluate leaders using two dimensions: Performance and extent to which they uphold company values 
Type 4 managers are the ones who deliver but do not share company values.
They destroy open, trust-based culture.

### Reverse Mentoring

With current fast paced technologies, I think this is really important. Pairing young employees with senior executes provides opportunity to share company values, strategic thinking process, new digital skills etc.
