## Belbin's Team Roles

I was introduced to [GE's Two-Decade Transformation: Jack Welch's Leadership](https://www.hbs.edu/faculty/Pages/item.aspx?num=67) paper during a management training program.

### Work-Out
Provided forum for employees to give suggestions to managers for improving processes and remove unnecessary bureaucratic work.

### Best Practices
Learn best practices from other successful companies.

### Developing Leaders
Provide clear understanding of where we are going (mission) and how we are going there (Behaviors/ Values).
At-least 70% of time on people issues (mostly teaching and developing others).
Providing freedom to team to be creative.
Inspire performance instead of forcing.

### Type 4 Managers
Instead of just looking at performance/ numbers, make sure company values are uphold.
Evaluate leaders using two dimensions: Performance and extent to which they uphold company values 
Type 4 managers are the ones who deliver but do not share company values.
They destroy open, trust-based culture.
