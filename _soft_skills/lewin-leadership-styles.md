# Levin’s Leadership Styles

Psychologist Kurt Lewin identified following three styles of leadership.

## Authoritarian (Autocratic)
* Task-oriented
* Leader does not involve team while making decisions or does not explain rationale
* Leader provides all the instructions about what needs to be done, how it needs to be done
* Micro-management, leader uses authority
* Does not nurture creativity, innovation
* Demoralizing and demotivating for the team
* Applicable in crisis management where quick decisions are needed
* Applicable in case of team with low skill levels

## Participative (Democratic)
* Team is involved in decision making, leader takes the final decision
* Nurtures creativity, innovation among the team
* High job satisfaction and productivity

## Laissez‐faire (Delegative)
* Hands-off leadership
* Team is left to make all the decisions with very little engagement from leader
* Effective when team is high skilled, independent and highly motivated
* Damaging in case team is not able to take responsibilities, plan work, distribute tasks
