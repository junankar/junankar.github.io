### Leadership Styles

* Telling (S1): Leader tells what needs to be done and how it needs to be done. Micromanagement, top-down approach, one way communication.
* Selling (S2): Leader try to sell ideas to get team on-board, open for suggestions.
* Participating (S3): Leader provides objectives, but participates as a team member in decision making. Team is given more responsibility. 
* Delegating (S4): Hand-off approach. Team takes complete responsibility.

### Team Readiness levels

The situational leadership theory identified four levels of team readiness and suggested appropriate leadership style for each of them. It also suggested leadership approaches in terms of directive (task oriented), supportive (relationship).

| Team Maturity Level      | Leadership Style  | Leadership Approach           |
|:------------------------:|:-----------------:|------------------------------:|
|R1 - Unable and Unwilling |Telling (S1)       |High Directive                 |
|R2 - Unable but Willing   |Selling (S2)       |High Directive and Supportive  |
|R3 - Able but Unwilling   |Participating (S3) |Low Directive, High Supportive |
|R4 - Able and Willing     |Delegating (S4)    |Low Directive and Supportive   |

## SLII®

Blanchard refined the model to “Situational Leadership II” (SLII®). This model defined team Development levels using competence (ability, knowledge, and skill) and commitment (confidence and motivation).

### Team Competence and Commitment

|Commitment | Competence | Developmental level               |
|:---------:|:----------:|:---------------------------------:|
|High       |Low         |Enthusiastic beginner (D1)         |
|Low        |Low         |Disillusioned learner (D2)         |
|Low        |High        |Capable but Cautious Performer (D3)|
|High       |High        |Self-reliant achiever (D4)         |

As team develops over the time, development level changes in the direction of D1 to D4.

### Leadership Styles

| Developmental level                | Leadership Style  | Leadership Approach               |
|:----------------------------------:|:-----------------:|:---------------------------------:|
|Enthusiastic beginner (D1)          |Directing (S1)     |High Directing and Low Supporting  |
|Disillusioned learner (D2)          |Coaching (S2)      |High Directing and High Supporting |
|Capable but Cautious Performer (D3) |Supporting (S3)    |Low Directing and High Supporting  |
